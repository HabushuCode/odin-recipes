        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Cochinita pibil tacos is a pork tacos.</strong><br>
                <b>Cochinita pibil</b> is a traditional Yucatec Mayan slow-roasted pork dish from the Yucatán Peninsula.<br>
                <i>Cochinita</i> means baby pig, so true cochinita pibil involves roasting a whole suckling pig. Alternatively, pork shoulder (butt roast), or pork loin is used in many recipes. 
                The high acid content of the marinade and the slow cooking time tenderizes the meat, allowing otherwise tough pieces of meat to be used.<br>
                Another important ingredient in all pibil recipes is <b>achiote</b> , which gives the dish its characteristic color and adds to flavor.<br>
                Traditionally, cochinita pibil is buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom to roast it.
