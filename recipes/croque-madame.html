            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 <em>ounces</em> of unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 <em>tablespoons</em> of flour</li>
                <li>1 <em>cup</em> whole milk</li>
                <li>1/4 <em>cup</em> of grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>8 <em>slices</em> of sourdough bread</li>
                <li>12 <em>slices</em> of ham</li>
                <li>12 <em>ounces</em> of Gruyere cheese</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make bechamel sauce.</strong> In a small saucepan, melt 1 ounce butter over medium heat. 
                    Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until you smell the flour and butter cooking, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Do not allow it to brown. Add the milk and bay leaf and cook, stirring from time to time, until the mixture thickens like a soup, 10 to 12 minutes. 
                    Remove the bay leaf and stir in the Parmesan. Transfer to a bowl to cool.</li>
                <li><strong>Arrange the sandwich.</strong> Arrange 4 slices of the bread on a flat surface. Top each with 2 to 3 slices of ham. 
                    Mix together half of the Gruyere cheese and the bechamel sauce. Taste for seasoning. 
                    Spread a little of the sauce on top of the ham and top each with another slice of bread.</li>
                <li><strong>Toast the sandwich.</strong> Heat a large cast iron skillet and, when hot, add half of the remaining butter. 
                    Add 2 of the sandwiches and brown on one side, 2 minutes. Turn on the other side and brown 2 more minutes. 
                    Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining butter and sandwiches. Spread the remaining bechamel on top of the sandwiches and top with the other half of the Gruyere cheese.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing and serve.</strong> Crack 4 eggs into the skillet, leaving a little room between each. While the eggs are frying, place the sandwiches under the broiler and broil until the top becomes golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                    Season the eggs with salt and top each sandwich with a fried egg. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
